      value: '<p>A person who wishes to observe a court in session may check the court calendar online or at the courthouse and watch a proceeding. The U.S. Constitution and court tradition give citizens right of access to court proceedings. Citizens gain confidence in the courts by seeing judicial work in action, and learn first-hand how the judicial system works.</p><h2>Access for Teachers and Students</h2><p>Teachers should contact their local <a href="/node/12916" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="587c8944-527e-46b0-ae1a-ae3255291fa1" data-entity-substitution="canonical">U.S. District Clerk''s Office to set up a visit</a>. Because the courts tend to be very busy, teachers should be prepared to allow several weeks of lead time when arranging a visit. The personnel in the clerk’s office can help teachers select an appropriate date for a class visit and can even find out what cases are on the docket if students wish to observe a court session. The clerk also will provide important logistical information, such as parking, for court visits. Some questions you may want to ask the clerk’s office:</p><ul><li>How many students may I bring to the court at one time?</li><li>Which days and times are best to bring students to the court?</li><li>What can my students do at the court?</li><li>If we come to see a specific case and it settles, is there a back-up activity we might do?</li><li>What web resources should we review before the visit?</li><li>What are the rules of court decorum and dress the students must follow?</li><li>Are there any judges who would be willing to speak to students? Prosecutors? Public defenders? Other court personnel? How can I set up a meeting with them?</li></ul><h3>Before Visiting a Court</h3><p>The best time to visit a court is during a unit on the judicial system or the rights that the system protects. In this context, students can put their new knowledge to use by observing and interpreting court sessions and finding out more information from judges and other court personnel. In particular, it may be helpful for students to learn about the structure, functions, and procedures&nbsp;of the court before attending.</p><h3>Follow up After Visit</h3><p>Following up on a visit to the court is just as important as the preparation for the visit. Teachers should reinforce learning from the court experience through continued classroom activities on the judicial system. Whenever possible, they should refer to what students learned while at the courts to help them make connections between the court and their classroom experiences.</p><p>It is also important to follow up with a note of thanks, preferably signed by the students, addressed to those who helped make the experience meaningful.</p><h2>Visiting a Courthouse</h2><p>Learning centers and educational exhibits across the country include:</p><h3>California</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.sacjlc.com/learning-center">Justice Anthony M.

The next time you&nbsp;are in Washington, you are invited to visit the courthouse to learn about these cases from the past that have an impact on American life today.
