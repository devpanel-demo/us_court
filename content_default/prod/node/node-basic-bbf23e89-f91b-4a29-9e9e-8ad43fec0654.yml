Clinton to the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York (New York City). Her sexual orientation, about which she was open, was not raised during her confirmation hearing and the Senate confirmed her appointment on a voice vote.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tBatts was sworn in on June 23, 1994 during Gay Pride Week in New York City. She was widely known for mentoring and inspiring a generation of law students and law clerks, some of whom joined her on the bench in the Southern District of New York more than a decade after her appointment. She died on February 3, 2020 at age 72.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring her college and law school years, Batts was a leader. She was the student body president at Radcliffe College, and at Harvard Law School she served on the editorial board of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review.&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n"
