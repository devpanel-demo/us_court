It takes into consideration various trends and issues affecting the judiciary, many of which challenge or complicate the judiciary’s ability to perform its mission effectively. In addition, this plan recognizes that the future may provide tremendous opportunities for improving the fair and impartial delivery of justice.</p><p>This plan anticipates a future in which the federal judiciary is noteworthy for its accessibility, timeliness, and efficiency; attracts to judicial service the nation’s finest legal talent; is an employer of choice providing an exemplary workplace for a diverse group of highly qualified judges and employees; works effectively with the other branches of government; and enjoys the people’s trust and confidence.</p><p>This plan serves as an agenda outlining actions needed to preserve the judiciary’s successes and, where appropriate, bring about positive change. Although its stated goals and strategies do not include every important activity, project, initiative, or study that is underway or being considered, this plan focuses on issues that affect the judiciary at large, and on responding to those matters in ways that benefit the entire judicial branch and the public it serves.</p><p>Identified in this plan are seven fundamental issues that the judiciary must now address, and a set of responses for each issue. The scope of these issues includes the fair and impartial delivery of justice; the public’s trust and confidence in, and understanding of, the federal courts; the effective and efficient management of resources; a diverse workforce and an exemplary workplace; technology’s potential; access to justice and the judicial process; and relations with the other branches of government.</p><h2>Strategic Issues for the Federal Judiciary</h2><p>The strategies and goals in this plan are organized around seven issues— fundamental policy questions or challenges that are based on an assessment of key trends affecting the judiciary’s mission and core values:</p><p>Issue 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="node/13287">Providing Justice</a></p><p>Issue 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="node/13305">Preserving Public Trust, Confidence, and Understanding</a></p><p>Issue 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="node/13312">The Effective and Efficient Management of Public Resources&nbsp;</a></p><p>Issue 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="node/13313">The Judiciary Workforce and Workplace</a></p><p>Issue 5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="node/13314">Harnessing Technology’s Potential</a></p><p>Issue 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="node/13315">Enhancing Access to Justice and the Judicial Process</a></p><p>Issue 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="node/13316">The Judiciary’s Relationships with the Other Branches of Government</a></p><p>These issues also take into account the judiciary’s organizational culture.
