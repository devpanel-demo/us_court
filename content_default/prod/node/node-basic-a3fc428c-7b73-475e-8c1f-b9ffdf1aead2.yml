            value: '<h2>What are Courts of Appeals?&nbsp;</h2><p>Federal courts of appeals review the procedures and the decisions in the district courts, also known as trial courts, to make sure that the proceedings were fair and that the law was applied correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The courts of appeals routinely handle more than 50,000 cases each year. Ten percent or fewer of those decisions are appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in turn hears oral arguments in fewer than 100 cases annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, most courts of appeals decisions are final, and they are binding on lower courts within the same circuit.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the Structure of Courts of Appeals?&nbsp;</h2><p>In the federal system, 94 district courts are organized into 12 regional circuits. Each circuit has its own court of appeals that reviews cases decided in U.S. district courts within the circuit. Unlike trial courts, appellate courts do not retry cases or hear new evidence; they do not hear witnesses testify; and there is no jury.&nbsp;</p>'
