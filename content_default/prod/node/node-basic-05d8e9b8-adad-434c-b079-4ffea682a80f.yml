These judges, often referred to as “Article III judges,” are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tArticle III states that these judges “hold their office during good behavior,” which means they have a lifetime appointment, except under very limited circumstances. Article III judges can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate.

They handle civil and criminal cases. A district court judge typically is responsible for supervising the pretrial process and conducting trials, which includes a variety of procedures including:</p><ul><li>managing the selection of juries and the instructions jurors receive throughout a trial;</li><li>ruling on admission of evidence;</li><li>pleas in criminal cases;</li><li>resolving any issues surrounding the acceptance of the verdict and entry of judgment; and</li><li>sentencing the defendant if a trial results in conviction.</li></ul><p>Learn more about district courts from the following resources:</p><ul><li><a href="node/2855">Civil Cases</a></li><li><a href="node/2856">Criminal Cases</a></li><li><a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/courts/u.s.-district-courts-and-federal-judiciary">Federal Judicial Center U.S. District Court History and Information</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Learn more about <a href="node/2769">appellate court and district court judgeships</a>, which are created by legislation enacted by Congress.</p><h3>Senior Judges</h3><p>Article III judges who have met age and service requirements set by federal statute are eligible to take senior status if they are at least 65 years old and have served at least 15 years on the bench, or any combination of age and years of service thereafter that equals 80. Regardless of age, judges must serve at least 10 years to qualify for senior status.</p><p>Upon taking senior status, judges may choose to handle a reduced caseload. Senior judges handle about 20 percent of the total district and appellate caseload. By taking senior status, even if maintaining a full caseload, a judge creates a vacancy on the court, to be filled by the nomination and confirmation process for Article III judges.</p><p>Senior judges receive the salary of their position at the time of taking senior status as an annuity.&nbsp;</p><p>Because there is no mandatory retirement age for Article III judges, there is no requirement that they take senior status.&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Types of Judges</h2><p>There are other types of judges and judicial offers preside over certain kinds of cases, matters, and proceedings.</p><h3>Magistrate Judges</h3><p>Magistrate judges are judicial officers of the U.S. district court appointed by the district judges of the court to handle a variety of judicial proceedings.</p>'

Bankruptcy judges must meet eligibility criteria, including being a member of the bar in good standing. Circuit councils&nbsp;may appoint a merit selection panel, consisting of judges and other legal professionals, to review and recommend candidates for appointment. &nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tBankruptcy judgeships are created pursuant to legislation enacted by Congress. Learn more about the history of bankruptcy judges from the following resources:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.fjc.gov/node/7486\">Federal Judicial Center Information on Bankruptcy Judges</a>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n\tRecalled Judges\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimilar to senior status Article III judges, bankruptcy and magistrate judges may continue to provide judicial assistance after they have retired. Generally, recalled judges exercise all the powers and duties that they had as an active judge. Circuit councils determine whether there is a substantial need for recall services from bankruptcy and magistrate judges based on court workload. In addition, recall requests that seek staffing or that cost more than a certain amount in additional salary and travel expenses must be approved by a Judicial Conference committee. Retired bankruptcy and magistrate judges are appointed for recall service for a specific period of time but no more than three years, which may be renewed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n\tVisiting Judges\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tVisiting judges who may sit by designation and assignment in any other federal court having a need for their service. They provide temporary assistance not only when a court’s own judges must disqualify themselves, but also to help meet the caseload needs arising from vacancies, lack of sufficient judgeships, specific emergencies, and other workload imbalances.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tJudges sitting with another court within their circuit are on an intracircuit assignment, which is approved by the circuit chief judge. Judges sitting with a court outside of their home circuit are on an intercircuit assignment. For Article III judges, intercircuit assignments must be approved by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Temporary assignments for bankruptcy and magistrate judges are coordinated by chief judges of the courts and circuits.\r\n</p>\r\n"
