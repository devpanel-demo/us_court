There is at least one district court in each state, and the District of Columbia. Each district includes a U.S. bankruptcy court as a unit of the district court. Four territories of the United States have courts that hear federal cases, including bankruptcy cases: Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.</p><p>There are also two special trial courts. The <a href="http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/"><u>Court of International Trade</u></a> addresses cases involving international trade and customs laws. The <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/"><u>U.S. Court of Federal Claims</u></a> deals with most claims for money damages against the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Types of Cases are Heard in District Courts?&nbsp;</h2><p>Within limits set by Congress and the Constitution, district courts have jurisdiction to hear nearly all categories of federal civil and criminal cases.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="/node/2856" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e74b443-e150-433f-9abd-2bfa5d25a3f8" data-entity-substitution="canonical"><u>Criminal cases</u></a> involve an allegation by the government that an individual or entity violated the criminal laws of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><a href="/node/2855" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef2e80ba-498f-4b8a-9dd9-747145f89162" data-entity-substitution="canonical"><u>Civil cases</u></a> arise from disputes involving the Constitution, federal laws, or treaties.
