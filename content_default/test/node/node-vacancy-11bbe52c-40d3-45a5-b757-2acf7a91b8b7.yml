            value: "The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa -10 through 34 (2006)) vests jurisdiction in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims over vaccine injury and death cases. Special masters, who are appointed by the court's judges, serve four-year terms, subject to reappointment for additional four-year terms. The special masters function as the trial judges in these often, medically complex vaccine cases. They oversee all aspects of record development, conduct evidentiary hearings, and issue final decisions, subject to appeal, on entitlement to compensation, on damages, and on attorney's fees and costs. Alternative dispute resolution processes are frequently used to resolve issues and demonstrated experience in that regard is beneficial."

              <ul>
              <li>The duties of probation officers require the investigation and management of convicted criminal offenders who present physical danger to officers and to the public. In the supervision, treatment, and control of these offenders, these duties require moderate to arduous physical exercise, including prolonged periods of walking and standing, physical dexterity and coordination necessary to operate a firearm, and use of self-defense tactics. On a daily basis, these officers face unusual mental and physical stress because they are subject to danger and possible harm during frequent, direct contact with individuals who are convicted of committing federal offenses.</li>
              <li>Because officers must effectively deal with physical attacks and are subject to moderate to arduous physical exertion, applicants must be physically capable. Any candidate the court is appointing to an officer position will be subject to a pre-employment medical examination. The applicant must be determined medically qualified prior to commencement of duties.  For additional information on the medical guidelines, please visit <a href="https://www.txwd.uscourts.gov">the Court's website</a> - click on Jobs, then Officer and Officer Assistant Medical Guidelines.</li>
              <li>First time appointees to positions covered under law enforcement officer retirement provisions must not have reached their 37th birthday at the time of appointment. Applicants 37 or over who have previous law enforcement experience under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees’ Retirement System and who have either a subsequent break in service or intervening service in a non-law enforcement officer position may have their previous law enforcement officer experience subtracted from their age to determine whether they meet the maximum age requirement.</li>

              <p><strong>Physical Requirements & Maximum Entry Age/Other Conditions of Employment</strong><br />
              The duties of U.S. Probation Officers require investigation and management of alleged criminal defendants or convicted persons under supervision who may present physical danger to officers and to the public. In the supervision, treatment, and control of persons on release/persons under supervision, these duties could require moderate to arduous physical exercise, including prolonged period of walking and standing, physical dexterity and coordination necessary for officer safety and use of self-defense tactics. On a daily basis, officers may face unusual mental and physical stress because they are subject to danger and possible harm during frequent, direct contact with individuals who are suspected or convicted of committing federal offenses.</p>
              <p>Because officers must effectively deal with physical attacks and are subject to moderate to arduous physical exertion, officers must be physically capable of effectively performing these duties and are subject to fitness for duty examinations.

              <p><strong>Prior to appointment, the selectee considered for this position will undergo a medical examination and drug screening. Upon successful completion of the medical examination and drug screening, the selectee may then be appointed provisionally, pending favorable suitability determination by the court. The incumbent must successfully complete a ten-year background investigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. In addition, as conditions of employment, incumbent will be subject to ongoing random drug screening, updated background investigations every five years, and as deemed necessary by management for reasonable cause, may be subject to subsequent fitness-for-duty evaluations.</strong></p>
              <p>Law enforcement retirement provisions require mandatory separation once an employee meets age and service requirements (age 57 with at least 20 years of qualifying service). The medical requirements and the essential job functions derived from the medical guidelines for probation officers, pretrial service officers and officer assistants are available for public review at <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/">https://www.uscourts.gov/</a></p>

              The U.S. Probation & Pretrial Services Office for the Western District of Michigan is accepting applications for the full-time position of Deputy Chief U.S. Probation Officer. Our probation office currently employs approximately 50 staff and is headquartered in Grand Rapids, with branch offices in Kalamazoo, Lansing, and Marquette.  

              The Deputy Chief Probation Officer primarily assists the Chief Probation Officer in the administration and management of the probation office within the district. As an integral part of the organization’s executive management and leadership teams, the incumbent will be responsible for providing high level leadership to formulate, supervise, and implement policy and initiatives to achieve organizational goals and objectives with a focus on strengths-based leadership and evidence-based practices. The Deputy Chief is the “alter ego” of the Chief Probation Officer and serves in that capacity during the absence of the Chief. A strong, collaborative relationship with the Chief Probation Officer is required.  The successful candidate must be able to foster and support an environment that emphasizes teamwork, professional enrichment, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

              <p><strong>Our Mission  </strong><br />
              It is the mission of the U.S. Pretrial Services Agency to safely reduce unnecessary pretrial detention. We do so by providing high quality investigation and supervision services that enhance community safety while respecting the presumption of innocence. We remain focused on providing services and support that promote positive, transformative change in the lives of those we serve.   </p>
              <p><strong>Position Overview</strong><br />
              The U.S. Pretrial Services Agency for the Northern District of California is accepting applications for a Pretrial Services Officer. Based on current office needs, it is anticipated that one position will be located in either the San Francisco office or the Oakland office. However, staff can be reassigned to other duty stations depending on the needs of the agency. More than one position may be filled from this vacancy announcement. In addition, this position has promotion potential to CL 27 or CL 28 U.S. Pretrial Services Officer without further competition.</p>
              <p>The U.S. Pretrial Services Agency, the bail investigation agency for the U.S. District Court, assists judicial officers with reducing unnecessary pretrial detention by providing timely, objective, and verified background information on defendants charged in federal court. The information provided to the court is used in setting reasonable, least restrictive bail conditions. A recommendation is made for detention or release with or without special conditions intended to reasonably assure community safety and appearance at future court proceedings. Defendants are supervised from the time of their release until sentencing or self-surrender to serve a prison term. The Pretrial Services Agency is also responsible for investigating and supervising pretrial diversion cases. Working with judges, attorneys, state and local law enforcement agencies, and treatment providers, the Pretrial Services Agency delivers services that benefit the defendant, the court, and the community.</p>
              <p>The Northern District of California covers 15 counties, primarily along the northern coast of California, from the Oregon border to southern Monterey County. Its headquarters is located in San Francisco, with division offices in San Jose and Oakland, and a satellite office in Eureka/McKinleyville. Travel inside and outside of the District is periodically required. All officers attend the Federal Probation and Pretrial Academy located at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
              <p><strong>Representative Duties & Responsibilities</strong><br />

              <ul>
              <li>Gather and verify background information concerning persons charged with a federal criminal offense promptly after they are arrested or summoned to court. Information is gathered through interviews with defendants, arresting authorities, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, family and community members, internet resources, automated criminal records, local and state court agencies, treatment and medical providers, and other collateral sources and investigative techniques.</li>
              <li>Evaluate information and prepare a well written report to the judge prior to the detention hearing with an assessment of flight risk and danger to the community. A recommendation for release or detention of the defendant is included in the report. In formulating a recommendation, the officer will consider prior convictions, supervision adjustment while under current/previous community supervision, availability of viable bail resources, community and familial ties to this District and/or to foreign countries, substance use or mental health concerns, and other aggravating and mitigating factors linked to risk of flight and danger to the community. Reports are completed within very strict time limitations.</li>
              <li>Supervise high risk/high needs individuals who are released on bond as ordered by the court. The officers will enforce and monitor court-ordered conditions by applying national and local supervision standards and guidance. In collaboration with their supervisor, the officer develops supervision plans for defendants using a blend of assisting and monitoring strategies that are centered on evidence based practices. The officer will maintain appropriate and “real time” case records. The officer will have personal contact with defendants at appropriate frequencies based on identified risks. These interactions are made through community (home and/or employment) contacts telephone/video conferences, and other community meetings (e.g. drug treatment site).

The officer will implement supervision interventions to positively modify defendant behavior in an effort to reduce the potential for bond violations and increase the potential for long term success. The officer must be able to address substance abuse, mental health, domestic violence, and similar problems promptly. This is done by assessing and implementing the most appropriate treatment and/or violation proceedings, Integral tasks for successfully supervising defendants include case management and referrals.

              <li>Be able to work during non-traditional business hours in order to complete bail investigations or manage compliance issues. There will be occasions when the officer will need to notify the court and the U.S. Attorney of any apparent bond violations during the weekends/holidays.

The officer will also be part of a weekend duty rotation. The officer will attend court hearings (initial, detention, violation, change of plea, sentencing) to provide additional information and to keep abreast of case status and requirements. Testifying may be necessary to support violation reports.</li>

              <p>Physical Requirement: The duties of a pretrial services officer require the investigation and management of criminal defendants who may present a physical danger to pretrial services officers and to the public. In the investigation, supervision, and treatment of defendants, these duties require moderate to arduous physical activity, including prolonged periods of walking and standing, physical dexterity and coordination necessary for officer safety, and use of self-defense tactics. On a daily basis, pretrial services officers face unusual mental and physical stress because they are subject to danger and possible harm during frequent, direct contact with individuals who are charged with committing federal offenses. As such, applicants to the position must be physically capable and able to handle moderate to arduous physical exertion.   </p>
              <p>Pretrial services officers must possess, with or without corrective lenses, good distance vision in at least one eye and the ability to read normal size print. Normal hearing ability, with or without a hearing aid, is also required. Any severe health problems, such as physical defects, disease, and deformities that may constitute employment hazards to the applicant or others, may disqualify an applicant.  Examples of health problems that may be disqualifying are an untreated hernia, cardiovascular disorders, serious deformities or disabilities of the extremities, mental health disorders, fainting and/or seizure disorders, metabolic disorders, bleeding disorders, pulmonary disorders, and marked speech abnormalities.   </p>
              <p>Prior to appointment, the selectee considered for this position will undergo a medical examination and drug screening. Upon successful completion of the medical examination and drug screening, the selectee may then be appointed provisionally, pending a favorable suitability determination by the court. In addition, as conditions to employment, the incumbent will be subject to on-going random drug testing as deemed necessary by management for reasonable cause and may be subject to subsequent fitness-for-duty evaluations. The medical requirements and the essential job functions derived from the medical guidelines for pretrial services officers (and pretrial services officer assistants) are available for public review at <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov./" target="_blank">http://www.uscourts.gov.</a>   </p>

As such, employment may be terminated by either the employer or the employee with or without cause. Federal Civil Service classifications/regulations do <strong>not</strong> apply; however, court employees are entitled to similar benefits as other federal employees. These benefits include participation in the Federal Employees Retirement System which contributes to the Social Security Retirement Program, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Thrift Savings Plan (similar to a 401k plan with employer matching contributions), paid holidays and annual/sick leave accrual.

              The Staff Attorney's Office serves the court at large rather than individual judges. Staff attorneys review case records and filings, conduct legal research, and draft bench memoranda and proposed opinions to assist the judges in the consideration and resolution of a wide variety of cases on appeal. Staff Attorneys develop expertise in civil and criminal procedure and in various areas of substantive law, including criminal, sentencing, immigration, employment discrimination, civil rights, habeas corpus, and Social Security. Additionally, a specialized team within the office assists the court in the initial review of all appeals for the purpose of determining appellate jurisdiction. Another specialized team presents substantive motions to the court, including motions for in forma pauperis status, certificates of appealability, transcripts at government expense, and withdrawal/substitution of counsel. Finally, our special appellate matters unit handles special projects from the court and tracks legal issues as they develop in the U.S. Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit.

              Please see our job announcement for additional details about the position, benefits, living in Atlanta, and how to apply.
