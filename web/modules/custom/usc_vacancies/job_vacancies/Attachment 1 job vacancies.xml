&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to meeting education requirements, applicants must also have specialized experience. A minimum of three years specialized experience is preferred. Specialized experience is progressively responsible experience, in such fields as pretrial services, probation, parole, criminal investigations, or work in substance/addiction treatment, public administration, human relations, social work, psychology, or mental health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience as a police officer, corrections, or prison guard, custodial, or security officer, FBI, Customs Agent, or U.S. Marshal &lt;strong&gt;does not meet&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;the requirements of specialized experience.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Qualifications:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to organize, prioritize work schedule, and work independently with minimal supervision.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to appointment, the selectee considered for this position will undergo a medical examination and drug screening.&amp;nbsp; Upon successful completion of the medical examination and drug screening, the selectee may then be appointed provisionally, pending a favorable suitability determination by the court.

&lt;p&gt;Applicants must be U.S. Citizens or eligible to work for the U.S. Government. Appointment is contingent upon providing proof of U.S. citizenship or proof of authorization to work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

A successful candidate must be mature, responsible, poised, organized and meticulous. Must also possess tact, good judgment, initiative and the ability to work with a wide variety of people with diverse backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Requirements &amp; Maximum Entry Age/Other Conditions of Employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The duties of U.S. Probation Officers require investigation and management of alleged criminal defendants or convicted persons under supervision who may present physical danger to officers and to the public. In the supervision, treatment, and control of persons on release/persons under supervision, these duties could require moderate to arduous physical exercise, including prolonged period of walking and standing, physical dexterity and coordination necessary for officer safety and use of self-defense tactics. On a daily basis, officers may face unusual mental and physical stress because they are subject to danger and possible harm during frequent, direct contact with individuals who are suspected or convicted of committing federal offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because officers must effectively deal with physical attacks and are subject to moderate to arduous physical exertion, officers must be physically capable of effectively performing these duties and are subject to fitness for duty examinations. Officers must possess, with or without corrective lenses, good distance vision in at least one eye and the ability to read normal size print. Normal hearing ability, with or without a hearing aid, is also required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-time appointees to positions covered under federal law enforcement retirement provisions must not have reached their 37th birthday at the time of appointment. Applicants 37 or over who have previous law enforcement officer experience under the Federal Employee&amp;rsquo;s Retirement System and who have either a subsequent break in service or intervening service in a non-law enforcement officer position may have their previous law enforcement officer experience subtracted from their age to determine whether they meet the maximum age requirement. State or local law enforcement time in service is not creditable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prior to appointment, the selectee considered for this position will undergo a medical examination and drug screening. Upon successful completion of the medical examination and drug screening, the selectee may then be appointed provisionally, pending favorable suitability determination by the court. The incumbent must successfully complete a ten-year background investigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. In addition, as conditions of employment, incumbent will be subject to ongoing random drug screening, updated background investigations every five years, and as deemed necessary by management for reasonable cause, may be subject to subsequent fitness-for-duty evaluations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement retirement provisions require mandatory separation once an employee meets age and service requirements (age 57 with at least 20 years of qualifying service). The medical requirements and the essential job functions derived from the medical guidelines for probation officers, pretrial service officers and officer assistants are available for public review at &lt;a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/"&gt;https://www.uscourts.gov/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Miscellaneous>&lt;p&gt;Employees of the U.S. District Court are appointed in the excepted service, are considered &amp;ldquo;at-will&amp;rdquo; employees, and serve at the pleasure of the Court. All employees of the Clerk&amp;rsquo;s Office are required to adhere to a Code of Conduct, copies of which are available upon request. All employees serve a one-year probationary period. As a condition of employment, the selected candidate must successfully complete a background check with law enforcement agencies and a check of financial and credit records. All offers of employment are provisional until a full suitability determination has been made. The Federal Financial Reform Act requires direct deposit of federal wages for court employees. Applicants must be a U.S. citizen or eligible to work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. District Court is a part of the judicial branch of the United States government. Although comparable to the executive branch (civil service) in salary, leave accrual, health benefits, life insurance benefits, and retirement benefits, generally court employees are not subject to the many statutory and regulatory provisions that govern civil service positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selectee for this position is subject to a criminal record check and satisfactory adjudication by the employing office to be eligible for employment. Due to the sensitivity level of this position, candidates may be asked about their criminal history prior to receiving a tentative offer of employment. Candidates completing the AO-78 must complete questions 18-20 regarding their criminal history. Criminal history is not in itself disqualifying. All available information, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, about the reliability and trustworthiness of an individual will be considered when making an employment suitability determination. Providing false and/or misleading information may be grounds for removal from&amp;nbsp;the application and selection process, as well as disciplinary action if discovered after an individual&amp;rsquo;s date of hire.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Miscellaneous>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Information for Applicants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Age Requirements for Federal Law Enforcement Retirement Provisions&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;There is no &amp;ldquo;maximum entry age&amp;rdquo; for this position. However, to be included under federal law enforcement retirement provisions, an individual would have to meet &amp;ldquo;maximum entry age&amp;rdquo; provisions. First-time appointees to positions covered under law enforcement officer retirement provisions must not have reached their 37th birthday at the time of appointment. For an applicant with previous law enforcement officer (LEO) experience under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and either a subsequent break in service or intervening service in a non-LEO position, the maximum entry age is increased by adding the number of years of previous law enforcement experience to 37. For example, for a candidate with five years of creditable previous law enforcement experience, the maximum entry age would be 42. If the selectee is currently in a federal hazardous duty position, mandatory retirement requirements apply. There is no mandatory retirement age for regular federal retirement benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief U.S. Probation Officer serves at the pleasure of the Court, is an &amp;ldquo;at will&amp;rdquo; employee, and can be terminated with cause pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &amp;sect;3602(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Investigation Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This position is a highly sensitive executive position within the Judiciary. First-time appointees must undergo a full OPM background investigation, a medical examination, and drug screening, as conditions of employment. Upon successful completion of the medical examination and drug screening, the appointee may then be appointed provisionally and conditionally, pending a favorable suitability determination by the Court. Additionally, the appointee will be subject to ongoing random drug screening and updated background investigations every five years and, as deemed necessary by the Chief Judge for reasonable cause, may be subject to subsequent fitness-for-duty evaluations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents seeking U.S. citizenship. Noncitizens must execute an affidavit indicating their intent to apply for citizenship when they become eligible to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Demands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work is performed in an office setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This position requires travel.&amp;nbsp;If an office vehicle is not available, the appointee is expected to use his or her personal vehicle and will be reimbursed for mileage pursuant to policy.&lt;/li&gt;

    <Miscellaneous>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information for Applicants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Court reserves the right to modify the conditions of this job announcement, or to withdraw the announcement, any of which may occur without prior written or other notice. In the event that a position becomes vacant in a similar classification, within a reasonable time of the original announcement, the Clerk of Court may elect to select a candidate from the applicants who responded to the original announcement without posting the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only qualified applicants will be considered for this position. Employees of the U.S. District Court serve under &quot;Excepted Appointments&quot; and are considered &quot;at will&quot; employees. Federal Civil Service classifications or regulations do not apply; however, court employees are entitled to substantially the same benefits as other Federal Government employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All information provided by applicants is subject to verification and background investigation. Applicants are advised that false statements or omission of information on any application materials or the inability to meet the following conditions may be grounds for non-selection, withdrawal of an offer of employment or dismissal after being employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participation in the interview process will be at the applicant&amp;rsquo;s own expense and relocation expenses will not be provided.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position is subject to the mandatory electronic fund transfer (EFT) participation for payment of net pay (i.e., Direct Deposit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-citizens may be interviewed and considered for employment, but employment offers will only be made to individuals who qualify under one of the exceptions in 8 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1324b(a)(3)(B). In most cases, this means that an offer of employment cannot be made unless the candidate is a lawful permanent resident who is seeking U.S. citizenship as explained below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under 8 U.S.C. &amp;sect;1324b(a)(3)(B), a lawful permanent resident seeking citizenship may not apply for citizenship until he or she has been a permanent resident for at least five years (three years if seeking naturalization as a spouse of a citizen), at which point he or she must apply for citizenship within six months of becoming eligible, and must complete the process within two years of applying (unless there is a delay caused by the processors of the application). Non-citizens who have not been permanent residents for five years will be required to execute an affidavit that they intend to apply for citizenship when they become eligible to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If selected for first time appointment to a position, you may be required to complete an initial performance probationary period. Failure to successfully complete the probationary period may result in termination of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <CourtName>California Northern Pretrial Services</CourtName>
    <PositionDescription>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Mission  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is the mission of the U.S. Pretrial Services Agency to safely reduce unnecessary pretrial detention. We do so by providing high quality investigation and supervision services that enhance community safety while respecting the presumption of innocence. We remain focused on providing services and support that promote positive, transformative change in the lives of those we serve.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The U.S. Pretrial Services Agency for the Northern District of California is accepting applications for a Pretrial Services Officer. Based on current office needs, it is anticipated that one position will be located in either the San Francisco office or the Oakland office. However, staff can be reassigned to other duty stations depending on the needs of the agency. More than one position may be filled from this vacancy announcement. In addition, this position has promotion potential to CL 27 or CL 28 U.S. Pretrial Services Officer without further competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Pretrial Services Agency, the bail investigation agency for the U.S. District Court, assists judicial officers with reducing unnecessary pretrial detention by providing timely, objective, and verified background information on defendants charged in federal court. The information provided to the court is used in setting reasonable, least restrictive bail conditions. A recommendation is made for detention or release with or without special conditions intended to reasonably assure community safety and appearance at future court proceedings. Defendants are supervised from the time of their release until sentencing or self-surrender to serve a prison term. The Pretrial Services Agency is also responsible for investigating and supervising pretrial diversion cases. Working with judges, attorneys, state and local law enforcement agencies, and treatment providers, the Pretrial Services Agency delivers services that benefit the defendant, the court, and the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northern District of California covers 15 counties, primarily along the northern coast of California, from the Oregon border to southern Monterey County. Its headquarters is located in San Francisco, with division offices in San Jose and Oakland, and a satellite office in Eureka/McKinleyville. Travel inside and outside of the District is periodically required. All officers attend the Federal Probation and Pretrial Academy located at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Charleston, South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representative Duties &amp; Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The incumbent will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather and verify background information concerning persons charged with a federal criminal offense promptly after they are arrested or summoned to court. Information is gathered through interviews with defendants, arresting authorities, the U.S. Attorney&amp;rsquo;s Office, family and community members, internet resources, automated criminal records, local and state court agencies, treatment and medical providers, and other collateral sources and investigative techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate information and prepare a well written report to the judge prior to the detention hearing with an assessment of flight risk and danger to the community. A recommendation for release or detention of the defendant is included in the report. In formulating a recommendation, the officer will consider prior convictions, supervision adjustment while under current/previous community supervision, availability of viable bail resources, community and familial ties to this District and/or to foreign countries, substance use or mental health concerns, and other aggravating and mitigating factors linked to risk of flight and danger to the community. Reports are completed within very strict time limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supervise high risk/high needs individuals who are released on bond as ordered by the court. The officers will enforce and monitor court-ordered conditions by applying national and local supervision standards and guidance. In collaboration with their supervisor, the officer develops supervision plans for defendants using a blend of assisting and monitoring strategies that are centered on evidence based practices. The officer will maintain appropriate and &amp;ldquo;real time&amp;rdquo; case records. The officer will have personal contact with defendants at appropriate frequencies based on identified risks. These interactions are made through community (home and/or employment) contacts telephone/video conferences, and other community meetings (e.g. drug treatment site). Some community contacts will be done during non-traditional business hours, including weekends and holidays. The officer will implement supervision interventions to positively modify defendant behavior in an effort to reduce the potential for bond violations and increase the potential for long term success. The officer must be able to address substance abuse, mental health, domestic violence, and similar problems promptly. This is done by assessing and implementing the most appropriate treatment and/or violation proceedings, Integral tasks for successfully supervising defendants include case management and referrals. When appropriate and necessary, the officer will assist defendants with locating non-contracted services/community resources, which includes food, shelter, drug and mental health treatment, education, and employment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to work during non-traditional business hours in order to complete bail investigations or manage compliance issues. There will be occasions when the officer will need to notify the court and the U.S. Attorney of any apparent bond violations during the weekends/holidays. The officer will have to prepare petitions for warrants and/or reports to the court recommending revocation or modification of conditions of release. The officer will also be part of a weekend duty rotation. The officer will attend court hearings (initial, detention, violation, change of plea, sentencing) to provide additional information and to keep abreast of case status and requirements. Testifying may be necessary to support violation reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <JobGrade>CL 26 - CL 28</JobGrade>
    <Miscellaneous>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Requirements:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Prior to appointment, the selected candidate must undergo a medical examination and drug screening. Upon successful completion, the candidate may then be appointed provisionally, pending a favorable suitability determination by the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers must possess, with or without corrective lenses, good distance vision in at least one eye and the ability to read normal size print. Normal hearing ability, with or without a hearing aid, is also required. Any severe health problems, such as physical defects, disease, and deformities that constitute employment hazards to the applicant or others, may disqualify the candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Investigation &amp; Maximum Entry Age Requirements:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As conditions of employment, the selected candidate will be subject to ongoing random drug screening, updated background investigations every five years and as deemed necessary by management for reasonable cause, may be subject to subsequent fitness for duty evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-time appointees to positions covered under law enforcement officer retirement provisions must not have reached their 37th birthday at the time of appointment. Applicants 37 years of age or older who have previous law enforcement officer experience under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System and who have either a subsequent break in service or intervening service in a non-law enforcement officer position, may have their previous law enforcement officer experience subtracted from their age to determine whether they meet the maximum age requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Demands:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Work is performed in an office setting and the community and may be subject to variable hours, including nights, holidays, and weekends. Work requires regular contact with people who have violent backgrounds. These contacts may be made in both generally controlled office settings as well as in field situations (such as uncontrolled and unsafe neighborhoods/environments where illegal activities and violence may occur). The duties of USPOs require the investigation and management of alleged criminal offenders or convicted offenders who present physical danger to officers and the public. In the supervision, treatment, and control of these offenders, these duties require moderate to arduous physical exercise, including prolonged periods of walking and standing physical dexterity and coordination necessary of officer safety, and use of self-defense tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditions of Employments:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Candidates selected for interviews will be required to participate in job-related screening as part of the screening process. Prior to appointment, the selected candidate must undergo a local records check, full OPM background investigation, fingerprinting, medical examination, check of financial and credit records, and drug screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selected candidate must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident seeking U.S. citizenship. Non-citizens must execute an affidavit indicating their intent to apply for citizenship when they become eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entry level U.S. Probation Officer position with a starting grade of CL-26 may be considered. The pay table used is dependent upon the assigned duty station. U.S. Probation Officer assignment hinges on the needs of the District. Promotion potential is possible within the classification and salary range without further competition, if assigned below CL-28. This position is considered hazardous duty, which may require irregular work hours, to include nights, weekends, and holidays. This position may also require frequent travel to divisional offices and a valid driver&amp;rsquo;s license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A probation officer appointed to serve with compensation may be removed only for cause, and may be entitled to some form of due process before being terminated (does not include pretrial services officers) (18 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 3602(a)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandatory separation age for positions covered under law enforcement retirement is 57, with 20 years of service (5 U.S.C. &amp;sect;&amp;sect; 8335(b),8425(b)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New USPOs receive extensive training during their year of employment. USPOs must also successfully complete a multi-week national training program at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (Probation and Pretrial Academy), in Charleston, South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. District Court requires employees to adhere to a Code of Conduct Policy. This position is also subject to mandatory Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) for payroll deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
